# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project, titled Around the US, is my first project using a figma design. It was an interesting set of challenges using HTML, and CSS. I used the grid property to set up the layout of the cards. I plan to make updates to the project once we begin to learn Javascript, adding functionality to the buttons.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
